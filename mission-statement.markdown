For any concept in Math, Physics, Chemistry, or Statistics there should exist one and only one “best explanation” of the concept. 

These "best explanations" should be "from The Book" in the spirit of [Paul Erdos'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erdős) book in which the best proofs from God are written.

Each "best explanation" should take the form of a 1-3 minute video that is

- Concise
- Memorable
- Delightful

## Why?

Such a resource should exist to **empower exceptional individuals** to:

- Build for themselves a rock solid foundation for learning
- Feel connected to the discoveries which are the greatest achievements of Western civilization
